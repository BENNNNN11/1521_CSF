# Week 01 Tutorial Answers

1. Consider the following C program skeleton:

   ```c
   int  a;
   char b[100];
   int fun1() {
       int c, d;
       ...
   }
   double e;
   int fun2() {
       int f;
       static int ff;
       ...
       fun1();
       ...
   }
   int g;
   int main(void) {
       char h[10];
       int i;
       ...
       fun2()
       ...
   }
   ```

   Now consider what happens during the execution of this program and answer the following:

   - Which variables are accessible from within `main()`?
     - All globals and all of `main`'s locals: `a, b, e, g, h, i`
   - Which variables are accessible from within `fun2()`?
     - All globals defined before `fun2`, and its own locals: `a, b, e, f, ff`

   - Which variables are accessible from within `fun1()`?
     - All globals defined before `fun1`, and its own locals: `a, b, c, d`

   - Which variables are removed when `fun1()` returns? 
     - All of `fun1`'s local variables: `c, d`

   - Which variables are removed when `fun2()` returns? 
     - All of `fun2`'s non-static local variables: `f`

   - How long does the variable `f` exist during program execution?
     - The variable `f` exists only while `fun2` is "executing" (including during the call to `fun1` from inside `fun2`)

   - How long does the variable `g` exist during program execution?
     - The variable `g` exists for the entire duration of program execution

2. Explain the differences between the properties of the variables `s1` and `s2` in the following program fragment:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   char *s1 = "abc";
   int main(void) {
       char *s2 = "def";
       // ...
   }
   ```

   - The `s1` variable is a global variable and would be accessible from any function in this `.c` file. It would also be accessible from other `.c` files that referenced it as an `extern`'d variable. C implementations typically store global variables in the data segment (region of memory).

   - The `s2` variable is a local variable, and is only accessible within the `main()` function. C implementations typically store local variables on the stack, in a stack frame created for function â€” in this case, for `main()`. C implementations typically place string literals such as `"abc"` in the text segment with the program's code.

3. Discuss errors in this code

   ```c
   struct node *a, *b, *c, *d;
   a = NULL:
   b = malloc(sizeof b); // sizeof b should be sizeof *b
   c = malloc(sizeof struct node); // sizeof struct node should be sizeof (struct node)
   d = malloc(8);
   /* 
   malloc(8) might be correct (depending on what struct node is) but is definitely non-portable, struct node might be 8 bytes on a 32-bit OS and 12 or 16 bytes on a 64-bit OS 
   */ 
   c = a;
   d.data = 42; // d.data is incorrect as d is not a struct its a pointer to a struct
   c->data = 42; // c->data is illegal as c will be NULL when its executed
   ```

4. What is a pointer? How do pointers relate to other variables?

   Pointers are variables that refer (point) to another variable.

   Typically they implement this by storing a memory address of the variable they refer to.

   Given a pointer to a variable you can get its value and also assign to it.

5. Consider the following small C program:

   Assume the variable `n` has address `0x7fff00000000`.

   Assume `sizeof (int) == 4`.

   What does the program print?

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   int main(void) {
       int n[4] = { 42, 23, 11, 7 };
       int *p;
   
       p = &n[0];
       printf("%p\n", p); // prints 0x7fff00000000
       printf("%lu\n", sizeof (int)); // prints 4
   
       // what do these statements print ?
       n[0]++;
       printf("%d\n", *p); // 43 
       p++;
       printf("%p\n", p); // 0x7fff00000004
       printf("%d\n", *p); // 23 
   
       return 0;
   }
   ```

6. Consider the following pair of variables

   ```c
   int  x;  // a variable located at address 1000 with initial value 0
   int *p;  // a variable located at address 2000 with initial value 0
   ```

   If each of the following statements is executed in turn, starting from the above state, show the value of both variables after each statement:

   ```
   a.  p = &x;       #  x == 0, p == 1000
   b.  x = 5;        #  x == 5, p == 1000
   c.  *p = 3;       #  x == 3, p == 1000
   d.  x = (int)p;   #  x == 1000, p = 1000
   e.  x = (int)&p;  #  x == 2000, p = 1000
   f.  p = NULL;     #  x = 2000, p = NULL
   g.  *p = 1;       #  error, dereference NULL pointer
   ```

7. Consider the following C program:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   int main(void)
   {
       int nums[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
       for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
           printf("%d\n", nums[i]);
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   This program uses a `for loop` to print each element in the array

   Rewrite this program using a [recursive function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science))

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   void print_array(int nums[], int i) {
     if (i == 10) return;
     printf("%d\n", nums[i]);
     print_array(nums, i+1);
   }
   int main(void) {
    	int nums[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
     print_array(nums, 0);
     return 0;
   }
   ```

8. What is a struct? What are the differences between structs and arrays?
   Arrays and struct are both compound data types, formed from other data types.

   Array are **homogeneous** - formed from a **single data type**.

   Structs can be **heterogeneous** - formed from a **multiple data types**.

   Array element are accessed with integer array indexes.

   Structs fields are accessed by name.

9. Define a struct that might store information about a pet.

   The information should include the pet's name, type of animal, age and weight.

   Create a variable of this type and assign information to it to represent an axolotl named "Fluffy" of age 7 that weighs 300grams.

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <string.h>
   
   #define MAX_NAME_LENGTH 256
   #define MAX_BREED_LENGTH 64
   
   struct pet {
     char name[MAX_NAME_LENGTH];
     char breed[MAX_BREED_LENGTH];
     int age;
     int weight;
   };
   
   int main(void) {
     struct pet my_pet;
     strcpy(my_pey.name, "Fluffy");
     strcpy(my_pey.breed, "axolotl");
   	my_pey.age = 7;
     my_pey.weight = 300;
     return 0;
   }
   ```

10. Write a function that increases the age of fluffy by one and then increases its weight by the fraction of its age that has increased. The function is defined like this:

    ```
    void age_fluffy(struct pet *my_pet);
    ```

    e.g.: If fluffy goes from age 7 to age 8, it should end up weighing 8/7 times the amount it weighed before. You can store the weight as an int and ignore any fractions.

    Show how this function can be called by passing the address of a struct variable to the function.

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>
    
    #define MAX_NAME_LENGTH 256
    #define MAX_BREED_LENGTH 64
    
    struct pet {
      char name[MAX_NAME_LENGTH];
      char breed[MAX_BREED_LENGTH];
      int age;
      int weight;
    };
    
    void age_fluffy(struct pet *my_pet){
      double old_age = my_pet->age;
      my_pet->age = my_pet->age + 1;
      double weightMult = my_pet->age / old_age; 
      my_pet->weight *= weightMult;
    }
    
    int main(void) {
      struct pet my_pet;
      strcpy(my_pey.name, "Fluffy");
      strcpy(my_pey.breed, "axolotl");
    	my_pey.age = 7;
      my_pey.weight = 300;
      return 0;
    }
    ```

    

11. Write a main function that takes command line input that fills out the fields of the pet struct. Remember that command line arguments are given to our main function as an array of strings, which means we'll need something to convert strings to numbers.

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    
    #define MAX_NAME_LENGTH 256
    #define MAX_BREED_LENGTH 64
    
    struct pet {
        char name[MAX_NAME_LENGTH];
        char breed[MAX_BREED_LENGTH];
        int age;
        int weight;
    };
    
    int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {
      if (argc < 5) {
        printf("%s needs 4 arguments to populate a pet.\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
      }
      struct pet my_pet;
      strcpy(my_pet.name, argv[1]);
      strcpy(my_pet.breed, argv[2]);
      my_pet.age = strtol(argv[3], NULL, 10);
      my_pet.weight = strtol(argv[4], NULL, 10);
      
      return 0;
    }
    ```

12. Consider the following C program:

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(void) {
        char str[10];
        str[0] = 'H';
        str[1] = 'i';
    	  // str[2] = '\0';
        printf("%s", str);
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    What will happen when the above program is compiled and executed?

    The above program will compile without errors . `printf`, like many C library functions expects strings to be null-terminated.

    In other words `printf`, expects the array `str` to contain an element with value '\0' which marks the end of the sequence of characters to be printed.

    `printf` will print `str[0]` ('H'), `str[1]` then examine `str[2]`.

    Code produced by `dcc `will then stop with an error because `str[2]` is uninitialized.

    The code with gcc will keep executing and printing element from `str` until it encounters one containing '\0'. Often `str[2]` will by chance contain '\0' and the program will work correctly.

    Another common behaviour will be that the program prints some extra "random" characters.

    It is also possible the program will index outside the array which would result in it stopping with an error if it was compiled with `dcc`.

    If the program was compiled with gcc and uses indexes well outside the array it may be terminated by the operating system because of an illegal memory access.

    

13. For each of the following commands, describe what kind of output would be produced:

    Use the following simple C code as an example:

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #define N 10
    
    int main(void) {
        char str[N] = { 'H', 'i', '\0' };
        printf("%s\n", str);
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    1. `gcc -E x.c`

       Executes the C pre-processor, and writes modified C code to `stdout` containing the contents of all `#include`'d files and replacing all `#define`'d symbols.

    2. `gcc -S x.c`

       Produces a file `x.s` containing the assembly code generated by the compiler for the C code in `x.c`. Clearly, architecture dependent.

    3. `gcc -c x.c`

       Produces a file `x.o` containing relocatable machine code for the C code in `x.c`. Also architecture dependent. This is not a complete program, even if it has a `main()` function: it needs to be combined with the code for the library functions (by the linker [ld](https://manpages.debian.org/jump?q=ld.1)).

    4. `gcc x.c`

       Produces an executable file called `a.out`, containing all of the machine code needed to run the code from `x.c` on the target machine architecture. The name `a.out` can be overridden by specifying a flag `-o filename`.
